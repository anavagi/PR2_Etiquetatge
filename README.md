# Artificial Intelligence Practice 2: Labeling 
### Universidad aut√≥noma de Barcelona - Computer Engineering
## Description

We have programmed different functions to implement the KMeans and KNN algorithms with the goal of solving the problem of image labeling based on different types of colors and shapes.

On one hand, the KMeans algorithm in this practice helped us find the different types of colors present in an image (eleven different colors). On the other hand, the KNN algorithm helped us classify the different clothing shapes into various labels, specifically into eight different labels.

The KMeans algorithm is an unsupervised algorithm, based on data clustering with the aim of calculating the specific number of classes, and then assigning each element to the nearest centroid.

The KNN algorithm is a supervised classification method (since it is already labeled) to calculate different parameters.
It is also possible to use different formulas for classification, but in this case, we will use the formula for the linear classifier, where the closest points are chosen. In other words, this algorithm classifies a data point depending on the surrounding data, 
where distance is a crucial factor in determining to which class it belongs.

In conclusion, we have implemented and discuss the different results obtained from conducting tests with qualitative analysis (retrieval by color, retrieval by shape), quantitative analysis (KMeans statistics, shape accuracy), and the improvements made to the KMeans and KNN algorithms.
